# **Customer Churn Anlysis: A Machine Learning Approach To Classification Models**

 In this project, we focus on building classification models to perform churn analysis on customer data, a critical task for companies looking to enhance their revenue by retaining customers.

Data Sources In this project, the dataset is spread across three different sources:

First Data Set: The initial 3000 records of the dataset are stored in a remote SQL database. You will need to access this database to gather the data.

Second Data Set: The next 2000 records are available on OneDrive in an Excel file named "Telco-churn-second-2000.xlsx". This dataset serves as the test dataset.

Third Data Set: The final portion of the data, comprising 2000 records, is hosted on this GitHub Repository in a CSV file named "LP2_Telco-churn-last-2000.csv". Additional information about the dataset's features and context can also be found in this repository.
